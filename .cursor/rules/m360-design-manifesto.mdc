# M360 — Design & Product Manifesto

## What We're Building

**Markets 360** — enterprise-grade analytical intelligence platform for brand monitoring, competitor analysis and market signals. Target audience: CMOs, strategists, analytics teams at major companies.

This is not a startup MVP. Every screen should feel like it could win a SaaS design award.

## Reference Aesthetic

Design bar: **Linear**, **Vercel**, **Stripe**, **Raycast**, **Superwall**.

- Clean, dark-first interfaces with precision spacing
- Typography-driven hierarchy — text does the heavy lifting
- Subtle depth through layering, not shadows
- Motion that feels engineered, not decorated

## Design Principles

### 1. Purposeful Restraint
Every element must earn its place. If it doesn't communicate something, remove it. No decorative borders, no filler gradients, no lorem ipsum animations.

### 2. Motion Standards
- Entrances: `easeOut` curves, 200–400ms
- Exits: faster than entrances, 150–250ms
- Spring physics for interactive elements (cards, toggles, modals)
- No motion without meaning — animation should communicate state change
- Use `framer-motion` as default animation library

### 3. Color
- Base: near-black backgrounds (`#0a0a0a`, `#0d0d0d`, `#111`)
- Text hierarchy: `white`, `white/70`, `white/45`, `white/25`
- Borders: `white/10` default, `white/20` on hover
- Accent: use sparingly — signal importance, not decoration
- Status colors: emerald (live/success), blue (demo/info), amber (wip/warning), red (error)

### 4. Spacing & Layout
- Base unit: 4px. Think in multiples of 4.
- Cards: `p-5` or `p-6`, `rounded-xl` minimum, never `rounded-md` for primary surfaces
- Grids: 12-column thinking, prefer 2–3 col on desktop
- Breathing room matters more than information density

### 5. Typography
- Font: system font stack or Inter
- Scale: limited — don't use more than 4 sizes per screen
- Weight contrast creates hierarchy (semibold titles, regular body, medium labels)
- All-caps labels: `tracking-widest` + `text-xs` + `font-medium` only

### 6. Interactive States
Every interactive element must have: default → hover → active → disabled.
Transitions: always `transition-all duration-200` minimum.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 App Router, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first, no CSS modules unless canvas/complex)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: custom SVG or Lucide
- **Canvas**: raw Canvas2D API for complex particle/physics animations
- **Deployment**: Netlify (static export)

## File & Component Conventions

- Pages live in `src/app/[route]/page.tsx`
- Shared components in `src/components/ui/` (atoms) and `src/components/sections/` (organisms)
- Data/config in `src/lib/`
- `"use client"` only when hooks or browser APIs are used
- Named exports for components, default export only for page files

## Dashboard Rule

`/dashboard` is the internal workspace index. When a new page or component demo is completed, add it to the `MODULES` array in `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`. Status: `live` | `demo` | `wip`.

## Communication Protocol

- Respond in **Russian** to this user
- When asked to "пушь" (push): update dashboard, update README, commit and push to GitHub
- Quality bar: if it looks like a template or a bootcamp project, redo it
- When in doubt: look at Linear.app and ask "would this fit there?"
